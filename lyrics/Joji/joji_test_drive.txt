test drive

She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive
Dying on the west side
I'll see you in the next life
What do you want babe?
I don't like when you taunt me
You've been calling the wrong name
I said what do you want, babe?
I'm working on my aim
I'm hoping you do the same
You got me afraid again
So let me just pray again
You gonna jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive
Dying on the west side
I'll see you in the next life
Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song you lied
You gonna jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive
Dying on the west side
I'll see you in the next life
