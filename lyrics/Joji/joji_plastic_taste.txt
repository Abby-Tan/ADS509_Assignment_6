plastic taste

I can't do this face to face
But I'll admit that I'm afraid
Let this romance go to waste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Excuse me for my plastic taste
Let these moments go to waste
Go to waste
