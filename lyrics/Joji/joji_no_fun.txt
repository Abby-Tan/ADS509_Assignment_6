no fun

Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Fuck my friends, they're gone
They all left one by one
And now that summer's done
They don't need no more fun
Yeah, I drive 'round on my own
I'm rich but my AC broke
Don't check no mail, no phone
And I tell them I'm not home
And I keep to myself
Fuck with no one else
And I know it's my fault
But I don't care
And I keep to myself
Who are you to pretend?
And I know it's my fault
It will never end
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive 'round on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my friends no
(No fun, no fun)
(No fun, no fun)
Yeah, I can't get no sleep
I look so good in green
I run, I run, I run (I run, I run)
And I don't have no more dreams
I drive 'round on my own
Feel dead, but I feel my bones (My bones)
I hide out on my throne (My throne)
Open up, now my cover's blown
Yeah, now my cover's blown
Yeah, now my cover's blown
Oh, now my cover's blown
Oh, now my cover's
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive 'round on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fu...
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
I drive 'round on my own
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
All they do is nothin'
Yeah, all my friends no
No fun, no fun, no
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun...
