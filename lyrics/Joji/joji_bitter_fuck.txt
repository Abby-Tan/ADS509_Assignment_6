bitter fuck

I find it hard to be myself
I shed my skin for everybody else
You don't know me, what the fuck you mean?
You made me sad and you made me mean
And now I'm mad I feel unclean
(I feel unclean, I feel unclean)
'Cause I'm a bitter fuck
I'm a bitter fuck
You made me a bitter fuck
Now I'm a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Your bitch is lame don't follow me
Your bitch just came all over me
I don't wanna live in my skin no more
I won't fuck with you if you don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me...
Now I'm a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
They call me a bitter fuck
They call me a bitter fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Now I don't give a fuck
Now I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
Yeah I don't give a fuck
Yeah I don't give a fuck
Because of you
Because of you
